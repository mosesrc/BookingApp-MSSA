Console App 
Booking Music Lessons

-- Initial thoughts:
- Gives a list of Instructors - maybe each instructor 
  has a file, Different Instructors for Different Instruments
- Let user pick how many lessons they want
- Lessons will be either 30 mins or an hour
- Pricing will be allocated based on how many lessons 
  user picks
- Allow user to schedule lessons between 1pm to 6pm
- Lessons would be scheduled weekly 
- It must show "Vacant" for open lesson times and
  "Booked" for lesson times not available
- Booked lessons should also show the first name of 
  User that Booked it
- Should give user a file to show all their lessons 

-- THINGS TO THINK ABOUT:
 - Can you remove a instructor
 - Can users remove a selected lesson time
 - There needs to be one Manager and Multiple users
 - Think about what can be shown in the console
	ex. Calendar, any representation of a log???
